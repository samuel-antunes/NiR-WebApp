# RGB + NiR Editing App

## Setup

To setup the project and virtual env I used <a href='https://python-poetry.org/'>poetry</a>, but it should be doable with regular pip.

### Poetry commands

- To start a virtual environment: `poetry shell`

- To install packages, run in the same directory as `poetry.lock`: `poetry install`

- To add a package: `poetry add <package-name>`

## Running

To run: `python manage.py runserver`
The webpage should be available at `localhost:8000`
